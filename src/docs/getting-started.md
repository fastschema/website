# Getting Started

## Installation

This section provides instructions on how to install FastSchema as a Headless CMS.

If you are looking to use FastSchema as a Web Framework, you can follow the instructions in the [Web Framwork](/docs/web-framework/) section.

### Method 1: Using Docker

1. **Pull the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/fastschema/fastschema:latest
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

   ```bash
   mkdir data
   docker run \
     -u "$UID" \
     -p 8000:8000 \
     -v ./data:/fastschema/data \
     ghcr.io/fastschema/fastschema:latest
   ```

::: details Example Output

```bash{2}
> Using app directory: /fastschema
> APP_KEY is not set. A new key is generated and saved to /fastschema/data/.env
> Using default sqlite db file: /fastschema/data/fastschema.db
> Serving files from disk [public:/files] at /fastschema/data/public
> Visit the following URL to setup the app: http://localhost:8000/dash/setup/?token=anpDXDBymatYLIITreQgGaVdhLanpDXD
```

:::

You can now process the setting up by visiting `http://localhost:8000?token={token}`.

_The setup token `{token}` is displayed in the terminal._

### Method 2: Download the Binary from GitHub Releases

1. **Download the Binary:**

   - Navigate to the FastSchema [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/fastschema/fastschema/releases).

   - Select the latest release.

   - Download the appropriate binary for your operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows). For example: `fastschema_0.1.0_linux_amd64.zip`

2. **Extract the Binary:**

   ```bash
   unzip fastschema_0.1.0_linux_amd64.zip
   ```

3. **Run the Binary:**

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.

   - Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded binary.

   - Run the following command:

     ```bash
     ./fastschema start
     ```

### Method 3: Build from Source

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fastschema/fastschema.git
   cd fastschema
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Build the Dashboard:** (Optional)

   ```bash
   cd pkg/dash
   yarn install && yarn build
   cd ../../ && mkdir -p private/tmp
   ```

   ::: warning
   You need to create an environment file `./pkg/dash/.env.production` for building the dashboard. Refer to `./pkg/dash/.env.example` for more information.
   :::

3. **Build and run the Binary:**

   ```bash
   go build -o fastschema cmd/main.go
   ./fastschema start
   ```

   or run the development server:

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

   ::: warning
   FastSchema requires Go 1.18 or later to build.

   `make dev` command uses `air` to watch for changes and automatically rebuild the binary

   You can install `air` by running `go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest`.

   For more information, refer to the [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) repository.
