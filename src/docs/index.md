## Overview

FastSchema core features are built on top of `schema`, a blueprint that outlines the structure of your content. This schema acts as the foundation upon which FastSchema builds your database tables and API endpoints, streamlining the development process and allowing you to focus on creating rich, dynamic content.

## Use Cases

- **A Backend as a Service (No-Code Solution)**

  FastSchema is an ideal solution for building backend applications with real-time data management, dynamic content modeling, and automated API generation, all without writing a line of code.

  It is designed to support API-first development, allowing you to define your content models and generate RESTful APIs effortlessly.

  With two line of commands, you can create a new project, define your content models, and start creating content instantly.

- **A Framework for web development**

  FastSchema is designed to be used as a framework for building web applications. It provides a set of tools and packages that simplify the development process.

  `Resource` is a core concept that represents an access point to your data. By defining resources, you can create custom endpoints and customize the behavior of your APIs.

  `Hooks` are functions that are executed before or after an operation is performed on a resource. A `Hook` can be a `resolver hook`, `database hook`, or `application hook`. They allow you to add custom logic to your APIs and extend the functionality of FastSchema.

  `ORM` is a powerful tool that simplifies the interaction with your database. It provides a set of methods for querying, creating, updating, and deleting records in your database.
